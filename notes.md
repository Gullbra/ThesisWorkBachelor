* However, its far-reaching implications are unknown as the level of covert usage
of steganography is unclear (s. 2)
*  if a suspect’s computer is found to have steganography
software loaded on it, an investigator would be tipped off to look more closely at certain file
types. (s. 2)
* Steganografi in child pornografy 2000 vs 2006
* Law enforcement may not be adequately trained or
have the resources to apply steganalysis to these types of investigations. (s. 3)
* Therefore, research should involve advancing methods of hiding content as
well as new tools to detect hidden content. (s. 3)
* Manual detection of steganography is
achievable by file comparison and ascertaining unusual file properties but the process could be
much more efficient with the use of commercially designed tools and targeted training. (s. 3)
* concluded that the solutions to steganalysis problems are not transferrable to real work
implementation (s .4)
* Criminals have hundreds of open-source steganography programs available online for
their use and they do not hesitate to use those programs (s. 4)
* allow law enforcement and the intelligence community
access to a repository of hash values for steganography applications for quick identification (s. 4)
*  allow for the use of consistent monitoring of non-suspicious communication
or any network monitoring without a warrant. (s. 5)
* claimed that identifying digital documents visually to determine if
hidden content exists is not reliable or effective. (s. 5)
* Currently, the design of most steganalysis
software is to detect only a particular steganographic signature. (s. 5)
* Detection is increasingly difficult
today as criminal activities include varying types of steganography and algorithms. (s. 5)
* unrealistic to expect the steganalyst to have knowledge of the cover
source, the algorithm used, and all the objects necessary for examination of hidden content. (s. 5)
* went on to state that users communicating covertly
transport hidden information in almost all types of digital file formats. However, users prefer
files with a high degree of redundant bits (s. 8)
* **Steganographic techniques** (s. 10)
* The most common form of digital steganography, according to Raggo & Hosmer (2013),
is appending data to the end of a file. Steganographic users often use this method on Joint
Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) files (s. 11)
* The least significant bit
(LSB), manipulation of Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), and the append technique are the
most common types of steganography used on image files (Kulkarni et al., 2009). LSB is an
example of a substitution method (s. 12)
* One recent example, the malware Duqu, hides information inside JPEG
images then uses the images to infect a network (s. 14)
* **Steganalysis is Used to Detect Covert Communications** (s. 15)
* is to determine whether a file contains a hidden
payload and once identified the investigation should include recovery of the payload. (s. 15)
*  Steganography is not an exact technique but research proves
hidden data can be found in some typical locations (s. 16)
*  two defined groups of steganalysis: static and dynamic (s. 16)
* **Blind detection approach** (s. 16)
* **Observation detection** (s. 17)
* **Fingerprints and signatures.** (s. 19)
* **Steganalysis tools.** (s. 21)

* This approach is very easy to detect. A
slightly more secure system is for the sender and receiver to
share a secret key that specifies only certain pixels to be
changed. (s. 93)

* Historically, this “security through obscurity” principle was never successful in the long term. (s. 1)
* Obviously, the less information we embed into the cover
image, the smaller the probability of introducing detectable artifacts by the embedding process. Each steganographic method
seems to have an upper bound on the maximal safe message
length (or the bit rate expressed in bits per pixel or sample) (s. 2)
* alette by adding to each color another color that is close
to it. The resulting palette will have a quite unusual structure
(clusters of close colors) that is practically never created using
